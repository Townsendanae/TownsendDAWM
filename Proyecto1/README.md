# TownsendDAWM

This project is about my personal portfolio. An attempt was made to add elements that I consider to be part of me, such as some other elements that were essential for the qualification of the project. Instead of creating an ordinary CV, we sought to add other aspects such as my hobbies or those things that I am proud of having done.

You will find a section with phrases that I like to think are true.

Enjoy :)
